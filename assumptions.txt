assumptions
1. inflow derivative can change any time
2. other derivatives are only dependent on relations
3. possible values reach between [min, neg, null, pos, max]
4. when we apply relations we only do that once for making connections between states
5. if a magnitude is at the max or min landmark the derivative cannot go into the direction of said landmark
6. that all states are realisticly generated computationally
7. that all value constraints are both ways and the one in the assignment goes for all types of values in the quantity it encaptures
8. if there is positve and negative inf/prop on a quantity, its allways ambiguis, even if one outnumbers the other
9. derivatives are always applied forst, thereafter the relations and finally the random change of inflow, concerning the edges between states
10. if ambiguity in relation following for edge drawing is encountered we ignore both.
